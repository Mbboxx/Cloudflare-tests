	Internet of things 
	high bandwidth available
	mobile network
	devices
- Data delivery from a set of producers to a larger set of consumers
-Data dissermination is the distributing & pushing data generated by a set of computing system, broadcasting data in the form of audio, video, text etc
-Output data is sent to the mobile devices. 
-Benefits of caches:
	Battery Power efficient
	Efficient utilisation of bandwidth

-Communication capacity/ data volume in the downstream direction(server -> clients) is greater than the upstream direction (client -> server)
-Content delivery is an asymmetric process.

Data Delivery Mechanisms
-Point to point (P2P)
-Broadcast:
	-push
	-pull(on demand)
	-hybrid

- in push broadcast the server broadcasts data using periodic/aperiodic intervals
- in pull the sever disemminates data on request from the clients

Push based mechanism 
- the server pushes data records 
- a structure of data records to be pushed is selected
- data is pushed at selected intevals/ adaptive algorithm
- bandwidth is adapted for downlink(List algorithms used in all steps)
- a mechanism to stop the push
QN: List advantages and disadvantages of push based mechanisms.

Pull Based mechanism
- the user pulls data records from the service producer's application database
- the pull based mechanisms works as follows:
	i. The bandwidth used in the uplink channel depends on the number of pull requests
	ii.A pull threshold is selected
	iii.A mechanism is adopted for the devices to pull data content from an appropriate cell
QN: adv & dis

Mobile Platforms
-iOS
-Android
-Windows

Newton OS
1) Micro kernel
2) OS services written in C++
3)  Newton script Application development environment which was an object-oriented language(OOL)

iOS
-iphone OS vs iOs
-it was released in 2007 and was the OS for the first iphone
-did not have support for 3rd party applications
-the iOS SDK was introduced for Mac OS which allowed developers to create third party applications for the iphone
-in the same year they introduced the app store which allowed users todownload free and paid applications on their phones
-in 2010 they decided to use the same OS in other devices and renamed the iphone OS to iOS
-it currently runs on ipad, iphone, ipod, iwatch, apple tv settop box
-one of the most highlighted features for users has been it's multi-touch capapbility
-it allows users to use multiple fingers simultaneously to interact with the mobile device using touch gestures
-multi-touch based interaction is a direct form of manipulation where users directly manipulate digital objects in a physical manner and receive direct feedback on their actions

iOS Architecture

	|Cocoa Touch Layer|
		|
	|Media Layer      |
		|
	|Core Services Layer|
		|
	|      Core OS     |

-the core Os deals with low level functionalities related to network configuration and communication,accessing the file system, memory allocation, virtual memory management, threading and multi process communication
-core services layer provides access to the key system services that are required by the applications.
-One of the fun is the core function framework which provides capabilities such as string management, socket communication and managing data types
- the core function framework's API are C based however it provides C wrappers for the interfaces provided for the coreOS
- provides capabilities providing        and also provides high level capabilities
- a major addition is the support for icloud storage which was introduced in 2011 and it allows 3rd part application to store data and access it from any of the apple devices
-it provides 2 types of storage, one for storing documents and the other for storing data that can be
-media layer

-the cocoa layer provides the multi-touch and gestures support, push notifications, maps, advertising framework
